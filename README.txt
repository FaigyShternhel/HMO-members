This project is a system of health fund members with the option of entering new data and displaying the data from the database. There is the option of editing, searching and deleting a member of the fund.
I chose to do the client side using REACT
and the server side using NODE.JS
I made the database with MONGOBD
To run the project enter the terminal and run the client side and the server side like this:
cd Client
npm i
npm start
and in parallel
cd Server
npm i
npm start
